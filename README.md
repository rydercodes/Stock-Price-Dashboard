# Stock-Price-Dashboard

Real-Time Stock Price Dashboard
- Data Collection: Use APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance) to fetch real-time stock data.
- Data Streaming: Set up a Kafka pipeline to continuously stream stock data.
- Processing: Use Spark Streaming for real-time transformations.
- Model Training: Train an LSTM model to predict stock prices.
- Dashboard: Display results in real-time using Plotly Dash or Streamlit.
- Deployment: Deploy the dashboard on a cloud service, ensuring data is updated in real time.




1. Data Collection
Objective: Fetch real-time stock data from an external source (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or IEX Cloud).
Steps:
Choose an API: Select an API that provides real-time stock prices. Yahoo Finance, for example, offers an API to retrieve stock data with the yfinance Python package.
API Authentication: Some APIs require an API key (e.g., Alpha Vantage or IEX Cloud), so set up an account and obtain an API key.
Fetch Data: Use Python code to fetch stock prices at intervals (e.g., every second or minute).
python
Copy code
import yfinance as yf
ticker = yf.Ticker("AAPL")
data = ticker.history(period="1d", interval="1m")  # fetch 1-minute interval data
Store Temporarily: For smoother streaming, consider storing data temporarily in a cache (e.g., Redis) before it flows into Kafka.




2. Data Streaming with Kafka
Objective: Stream the collected stock data continuously into a processing pipeline.
Steps:
Set Up Kafka: Install Apache Kafka and create a topic (e.g., “stock_prices”) to stream data into.
Kafka Producer: Write a Python script to act as a Kafka producer that continuously sends the stock data to the “stock_prices” topic.
python
Copy code
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', 
                         value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'))

# Send data to Kafka in a loop
while True:
    stock_data = get_stock_data()  # function to fetch data
    producer.send('stock_prices', value=stock_data)
Producer Scheduling: Set up the producer to run at a specified interval (e.g., every 5 seconds) to ensure the data stream remains active.


3. Real-Time Data Processing with Spark Streaming
Objective: Process the incoming stock data to calculate metrics, detect trends, or prepare it for further analysis.
Steps:
Configure Spark Streaming: Set up a Spark Streaming job to consume data from the Kafka topic.
Define Transformations: Perform transformations on the data, such as calculating moving averages, volume-weighted prices, and percent changes.
Process Data: Use Spark’s DataFrame API for real-time calculations.
python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import avg

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("StockStream").getOrCreate()
df = spark.readStream.format("kafka") \
     .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092") \
     .option("subscribe", "stock_prices").load()

# Example transformation: moving average
processed_df = df.groupBy("ticker").agg(avg("price").alias("moving_avg"))
Output Processed Data: Output the processed data to another Kafka topic or directly to the dashboard database (e.g., PostgreSQL).



4. Model Training with LSTM
Objective: Train an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for stock price prediction.
Steps:
Historical Data Collection: Gather historical stock data to train the model.
Data Preprocessing: Scale features and prepare data for time-series modeling (e.g., creating sequences for LSTM input).
python
Copy code
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(historical_data)
Build the LSTM Model: Use TensorFlow or PyTorch to define the LSTM model architecture.
python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(50),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
Training: Train the model on historical stock data.
Save Model: Save the trained model for deployment and integration with real-time data.




5. Dashboard Development with Plotly Dash or Streamlit
Objective: Create an interactive dashboard that displays stock price predictions and live data visualizations.
Steps:
Set Up the Dashboard Framework: Choose either Plotly Dash or Streamlit for rapid dashboard creation.
Data Visualization: Implement visualizations such as line charts for stock prices, bar charts for volume, and tables for detailed data.
python
Copy code
import streamlit as st
import plotly.graph_objs as go

fig = go.Figure(go.Scatter(x=times, y=prices, mode='lines', name='Stock Price'))
st.plotly_chart(fig)
Real-Time Updates: Use WebSockets or periodic data fetches to ensure the dashboard updates with the latest data.
User Interface (UI) Enhancements: Add interactive filters, date range selectors, and display widgets for a smoother user experience.



6. Deployment on Cloud
Objective: Deploy the entire dashboard application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) and ensure scalability.
Steps:
Choose a Cloud Platform: Decide on a platform, such as AWS EC2 for the dashboard server, or AWS Lambda for serverless deployment.
Containerization: Use Docker to containerize the application, making it easier to deploy and scale.
dockerfile
Copy code
# Example Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
Database Integration: Store processed data in a managed cloud database (e.g., RDS on AWS or Cloud SQL on Google Cloud).
Monitoring and Scaling: Use cloud-native monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) to monitor performance and set up autoscaling rules to handle increased traffic.
